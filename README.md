## User Accounts
---
After following their guide at https://pocketbase.io/docs/ and creating your first superuser, it's time create your first user within the users collection. This is the account you use to login with on the /frontend. Or, register an account on the frontend, it should register the new user perfectly :).

That's it. Get developing.

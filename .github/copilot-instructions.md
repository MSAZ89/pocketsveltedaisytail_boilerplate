always use tailwind css for styling the project!

always use typescript for the project!

always use svelte 5 runes mode for the project! this includes the new $state store! export let name: string = $state.name; you don't need to import anything!

try not to change any of our variable names or styling we have in-place throughout the project, just update as we need to.

Buttons and links should either contain text or have an `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` attribute.

Using `on:click` to listen to the click event is deprecated. Use the event attribute `onclick` instead in svelte5.

put a comment with the file name at the top of each code edit, so we know where to look for the changes. eg //component.svelte
